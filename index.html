<p>Yesterday I had a talk with my friend on cafe bar, we focused on
career, hobby, personality and so on.</p>
<p>This is the first time that I spent such long time on call with
female. Surprisingly, I found her thoughts are much deeper then me,
also, ambitious.</p>
<p>But, I still think that she is still missing something, what’s
that?</p>
