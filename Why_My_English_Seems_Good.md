# Why My English Seems Good

**First, let me correct the title:** my English isn’t that good—at least, it’s not as good as I thought it should be. But since someone asked, I’ll just go ahead and write an honest article to answer them.

## The Beginning

I have to thank my mom for this.

When I was in fifth grade, my mom took the advice of a teacher, bit the bullet, and spent over a hundred thousand yuan to send me to Meten English. At the time, it was one of the top English training institutions in Guangdong, alongside EF.

There, you were mostly required to use English. Except when chatting with Chinese teachers and classmates after class, in class, you could only use English. Using Chinese wasn’t encouraged. If you did, most people would give you strange looks: “Why are you still speaking Chinese here?”

Of course, I didn’t learn that much. Otherwise, I’d have gone abroad long ago, haha. What I did most often back then was sneak off to the cinema after class. Meten had a small cinema in each branch, and it was pretty nice. _2 Broke Girls_, _Pirates of the Caribbean_, _Inception_, _The Big Bang Theory_... I watched all these familiar Western movies and shows at least five times each. Even though they had Chinese subtitles, I could more or less guess the story from the tone and emotions of the actors without them.

I also became familiar with a few foreign teachers, and they always called me “Little Alan” — every student at the institute was assigned an English name. Many years later, I still keep in touch with one or two of them. Whenever we can, we send voice messages.

## Middle School

Well, in middle school, my English was the best in the class—both extracurricular and academic, no competition. I took part in several English-related activities, like drama performances and speeches. I really enjoyed the feeling of being able to have a face-to-face conversation with foreigners. Rather than saying I loved English, I would say I loved communicating with people from all walks of life. English was just a tool.

## High School

Hmm, this part isn’t so straightforward. There were some real masters in high school. I clearly remember one guy in my class named Pascal, who said he could talk with foreigners in a pub all day long—and he really could. No matter how laid-back he was, I just couldn’t beat him in English. Later, I realized there were several reasons for that: first, my reading and writing were weak; second, I was just tired of the exam-oriented education. It was boring. If your grades are better than someone else’s, it means your English is better. What’s the point of that? Anyway, let’s skip over high school, haha. My grades weren’t great.

## College

Before I entered college, I’d heard that the Software Engineering program required a high level of English proficiency because a lot of the best resources are abroad. So, in my first and second years, I set everything I used to English—everything you can think of, including Xuexitong.

But deep down, I hesitated. A lot of people would tell me, “There are Chinese translations for everything now, why are you making things so hard on yourself? Isn’t Google Translate good enough?”

At the time, two voices were fighting in my head: one said, “This is ridiculous! A Chinese person who doesn’t use Chinese? Are you trying to act like a foreigner? The world is going to be China’s world from now on! Just use Chinese, and you’ll learn technology faster.” The other said, “Short-sighted! Reading and using an English environment is a necessary skill for the future. What if you go abroad? Even if you don’t, you’ll still learn a lot.”

In the end, one person completely changed the course of my personal history: our Software Engineering professor, Yang Shaoyu.

It was late in my third year, and the pandemic was severe. After a few classes, the school immediately told us to go home. I have a habit of chatting with my professors after class to make a good impression, just in case I end up failing the course.

That night after the class, I went up to Professor Yang to chat and asked him for the full English PDF of a book called _Introduction to Algorithms_. I’d actually already read it, but I just brought it up to seem like I was studying. He took my USB stick with a serious face, copied the file, and said to me, “I don’t think you’ll be able to understand it at your level. Honestly, just stick to the Chinese version. It’s going to be all in Chinese from here on out.”

I was furious. No one talks about my English like that! Who the hell do you think you are?

I took my USB stick, smiled, and walked back to my dorm with determination. From that moment on, no one would think my English was bad! I was going to stick to it, no matter what!

Back at home, I did these things:

- Asked my parents for money to buy English books. If I couldn’t buy them, I printed them out. At the time, I was really into reading some Linux cookbooks, so I printed those out. I’d bring them to meet friends, and at the café, I’d just read. I also had a 1000-page English math book, _Calculus: An Intuitive and Physical Approach_. I’d read it at Starbucks, reading it hard, even though I still had over 200 pages left.
- Learned to code in English, read technical documentation in English, and then taught whoever I could get to listen (mostly girls). It was a bit like a lab experiment, but well, no regrets, haha.
- Joined various foreign tech communities, like Wikipedia, StackOverflow, and GitHub. I also explored some Telegram groups and eventually settled into the Arch Linux group. By the way, I started tinkering with Linux distros in my second year, and by my third year, Arch Linux became my primary operating system. If I wasn’t browsing Chinese websites, using WeChat, or doing schoolwork, you’d see me operating just like a typical foreign tech nerd.

I’ve kept this up until now. Actually, it’s no longer a matter of “sticking to it”; I consider it something I have that many people don’t.

## Unexpected Gains

After realizing that I read articles slower than others, I looked for solutions and found a post on Zhihu that really hit home: Chinese people often try to learn English the same way they learn Chinese characters. I can’t remember where the original post is, so I’m just going to summarize the key points:

1. Chinese people like to use translation to learn English. When they see an English sentence or article, or talk to foreigners, or write in English, they always go through a process of translating it into Chinese in their heads, then translating it back to English.
2. Cutting up sentences. Because of exam-oriented education, or because that’s how we’ve been taught since we were young. We love dissecting sentences into subject, verb, and object, or breaking them apart instead of looking at them holistically. Sure, knowing which part is the object helps us quickly grasp the main points, but you don’t need to do it for every sentence...

The first point really struck me. The author’s suggestion was to forget the process of learning English the way we’re taught in China. Use English textbooks, English dictionaries, and explain things in English. If necessary, just learn through pictures.

Since then, I pretty much followed what the author suggested: I stopped using Chinese-English dictionaries, and the online dictionary recommended by my Meten foreign teacher became my go-to. I read books, watched videos, and articles, and tried to understand foreign mindsets—all in English.

## Conclusion

@DuoDuo once asked me, “I want to ask how your English improved. Can you share your experience?” Honestly, I never intentionally worked on improving my English. I just intentionally placed myself in an English environment. My mindset is this: English is just a tool, like Chinese. As Chinese people, we speak Chinese so fluently; you wouldn’t ask me how I improved my Chinese, right?

Looking back at my experiences from childhood to now, you’ll see that English is just an environmental thing.

I hope my humble story can offer some help to you all.
